## Overview of the AI Agent Architecture
This agent is built using a modern AI architecture that combines large language models (LLMs) with specialized tools. The fundamental design pattern follows what's known as a "tool-using agent" architecture, where an LLM acts as the brain that can reason about problems and decide which specialized tools to use to accomplish tasks.
Core Components and Technologies

### Framework: LangChain
LangChain is an open-source framework designed specifically for building LLM-powered applications.
It provides the scaffolding for connecting language models to external tools and data sources.


### Language Model: OpenAI's GPT model
We used gpt-4, which supports function calling.
This allows the model to determine when to use which tools in a structured way.


### Agent Type: OpenAI Tools Agent
We implemented the agent using LangChain's create_openai_tools_agent pattern.
This pattern leverages OpenAI's function calling capabilities for reliable tool selection.


### User Interface: Gradio
Gradio provides a simple way to create web interfaces for machine learning models.
We built a chat interface where users can interact with the agent in natural language.


### External APIs: NewsAPI
For real-time news data, we integrated with NewsAPI.
This allows the agent to fetch current news about any topic or location.
